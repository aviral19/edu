This is a list of common scenarios you might face - may this list be with you.

### How to "store" a DOM element from the examples?

`examples/simple.js`

~~~
var App = require("fancy-biojs-app");
var instance = new App({el: yourDiv, <other options>});
~~~

`index.js`

~~~
module.exports = function(opts){
  var el = opts.el;
}
~~~

### How to receive a file?

`examples/simple.js`

~~~
var xhr = require("xhr");
var App = require("fancy-biojs-app");
var dataPath = "<relative path to your file>";
xhr(dataPath, function(err,status, body){
  var instance = new App({el: yourDiv, model: body});
});
~~~

You need to add the "xhr" module in the [exposed section](/details/package_json/) of the snippet configuration.
Instead of "xhr", you could also use `jQuery.load`, or `d3.csv` etc.
Consider you structured your files like the following:

~~~
|- data
|  - dataset.tsv
|- examples
|  - simple.js
~~~

In this example `dataPath` would be `../data/dataset.tsv` (or `/data/dataset.tsv`).
You need to create the `data` folder yourself, but the naming is up to you.

### How to have default options?

`examples/simple.js`

~~~
var App = require("fancy-biojs-app");
var instance = new App({el: yourDiv, fancyColor: blue});
~~~

`index.js`

~~~
var extend = require("js-extend").extend // you could also use underscore or jQuery
module.exports = function(userOpts){
  var opts = {
   fancyColor: "red"
  }
  opts = extend(opts, userOpts);
  var el = userOpts.el;
}
~~~
